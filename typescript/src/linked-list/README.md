# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure that alows you to fast store data not indexing them when apeending.

- **Advantage**
    Quick Insertions and deletions (at the first element of the linked list)

- **Disadvantage**
   Access times are linear *O(n)* making it **difficult to pipeline**. Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. **Arrays have better cache loocality** as compared to liked lists.
